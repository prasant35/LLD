# Low Level Design (LLD) Practice

## 📚 Overview
This repository contains my practice implementations of various design patterns and low-level design concepts. I'm currently following the "Head First Design Patterns" book and implementing the examples in C++.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Practice and understand design patterns
- Implement book examples in C++
- Document learning journey
- Create reusable design pattern templates

## 📂 Repository Structure
```
design_patterns/
├── behavioral/
│   ├── observer/         # Weather Station Example
│   └── strategy/         # Duck Behavior Example
├── creational/
└── structural/
```

## 🚀 How to Run
Each pattern implementation includes:
- Source code in respective directories
- Compilation instructions

Example (Observer Pattern):
```bash
cd design_patterns/behavioral/observer
g++ main.cpp -o weather_program
./weather_program
```

## 📝 Notes
- All implementations are in C++
- Test cases where applicable
